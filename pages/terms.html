It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.

                                                                        PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
